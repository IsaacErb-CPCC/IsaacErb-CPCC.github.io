		<h2>Course Contract</h2>
		<p>I, <a href="introductions.html">Isaac N. Erb</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my 2024-Fall <q>WEB115, Web Markup and Scripting</q> course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>

		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

		<p>Signed: <i>Isaac N. Erb, 13 August 2024</i>.</p>
