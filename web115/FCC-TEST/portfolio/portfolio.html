				<h3>Iron (Font)</h3>
				<img src="https://isaacerb-cpcc.github.io/web115/FCC-TEST/iron-example.png">
				<span>A bold, proportional sans-serif font I made because I wanted a good general-purpose font. It is stylistically based off of Bahnschrift, which is stylistically based off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451" target="_blank">DIN 1451</a>.</span>

				<h3>Carbon-13 (Font)</h3>
				<img src="https://isaacerb-cpcc.github.io/web115/FCC-TEST/c13-example.png">
				<span>My own take on how the classic &lsquo;dot-matrix&rsquo; style of font should look. This style of font is nothing new; if you've played Minecraft, you've seen it. But all-such fonts I've seen do things I don't like, so I decided to make my own.</span>

				<h3>Riika & Chineu (Book)</h3>
				<img src="https://isaacerb-cpcc.github.io/web115/FCC-TEST/chineu-example.png">
				<span>This is the second book I've written, and is basically an immigration-story, with protagonist's character-arc focusing on a conflict between curiosity and fear of the unknown.</span>
