	<dd>Shows understanding of looping and reusable, genericized code.<br>(Fun Fact: Because I'm a font-developer, I know about four more roman numerals than FCC does, and my program can actually properly convert numbers as large as 399'999; it just doesn't because they've specified a hard limit of 3999. The numerals are &#8577; [5000], &#8578; [10'000], &#8583; [50'000], and &#8584; [100'000].)</dd>

	<dd>Shows understanding of classes.<br>I couldn't get this one to work, and I'm not sure why; I don't know what exactly FCC's tests are checking for, and this is, by far, the most complex assignment in JADS.<br>I had a previous build for this project that did all of the stuff they specified, but didn't satify the tests. The current build is a partial rewrite I did while keeping the code simpler and checking each step of the assignment as I added the corresponding pieces of functionality to the program. I gave up because I got to a check I couldn't figure out how to satisfy, so the program is incomplete.</dd>

	<dd>Shows understanding of <code>fetch()</code>-commands and working with JSON-formatted data.<br>(I spell it <q>Pokemon</q>, and not <q>Pok&eacute;mon</q>, because the accent-mark is not a correct inclusion under either of the major systems of transcription from japanese; they just put it in the english translation because they thought english-speakers would mispronounce the proper transcription. And they were right; even <i>with</i> the accent-mark, many english-speakers still mispronounce it.)</dd>
