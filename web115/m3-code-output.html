		<h3>This Page</h3>
		<p>This page shows Isaac Erb's efforts to fulfill the requirements of the M3 <q>Codeplay</q>-assignment.</p>
		<p>The below text shows explanations with normal body-text-formatting, and highlights code-text with a green background. Within the highlighted text, inputs are shown in bold; outputs are at a normal weight, with a <q>&#187;</q> symbol in front of them.</p>
		<p>When it says <q><code>undefined</code></q> in the output, that's because the statement has executed successfully, but there's no return value.</p>
