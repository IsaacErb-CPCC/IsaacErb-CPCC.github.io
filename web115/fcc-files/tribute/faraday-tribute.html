			<p>Michael Faraday (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society">FRS</a>) was a english physicist who was instrumental to our modern understanding of electromagnetism. Faraday was so important to our understanding of this fundemental force of the universe that Albert Einstein kept a picture of him on his study wall, along with those of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell.</p>

				<li><b>1791</b>: Michael Faraday is born into a poor family in London.</li>
				<li><b>1812</b>: Faraday successfully performs electrolysis on sulfate of magnesium, using a voltic pile made out of seven brittish halfpennies, sheets of zinc, and paper soaked in salt-water. This is well before the process of electrolysis is well-understood.</li>
				<li><b>1821</b>: Faraday invents the earliest form of electric motor, built out of a magnet, a pool of mercury, a wire, and a chemical battery. This is the first experiment to prove that electric currents and magnets can interact to produce controled motion.</li>
				<li><b>1831</b>: Faraday builds the world's first electric generator, centred around a horseshoe-shaped magnet and a disk of copper spinning between its poles.</li>
				<li><b>1832</b>: Faraday successfully conducts a series of experiments proving that electricity from various sources (static, battery-fed, bioelectric) all behaves the same way, refuting the then-popular idea that these sources all produce separate phenomena.</li>
				<li><b>1836</b>: Faraday tests an apparatus now know as a Faraday-cage, entering a small room with charged wires running along all walls, and emerging unharmed by electricity. This proves his theory that electricity repels itself.</li>
				<li><b>1845</b>: Faraday conducts the first experiments showing that light bends around magnets, showing some of the first experimental proof of a link between light and electromagnetism, and also setting the stage for the modern visualization of magnetic fields.</li>
				<li><b>1867</b>: Michael Faraday dies at the age of 75.</li>
