	<main>
		<p>This is a page introducing me, Isaac Erb, as a participant in the 2024-Fall <q>WEB115-N801</q> course.</p>
		<p>I'm a 21-year-old college student, working toward an Associate's Degree in Full Stack Programming. In addition to that, I'm also pursuing writing, font-design, and drawing when I have the time. (Though I'm still very bad at drawing.)</p>
		<h3 class="list-header">Other Information about Me:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li id="additional-personal">
				<h4>More about Me:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I will accept any pronouns you might use for me, but I default to <q>he/him</q>.</li>
					<li>My native language is English. I can also speak (but not read) Japanese. I could probably communicate in other languages if necessary (via Google Translate), but those are the only two I actually know.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li id="professional">
				<h4>Professional Background:</h4> None, in the sense of having gotten paid to do work. I've done several interviews, though.
			</li>
			<li id="academic">
				<h4>Academic Background:</h4> As mentioned earlier, I'm currently working toward an Associate's in programming. I also have my highschool diploma, and credits from a trade-school course on proper operation of an oxyfuel cutting-torch.
			</li>
			<li id="subject-specific">
				<h4>Background in this Subject:</h4> I have taken one course before this which had me work extensively with HTML and CSS. <br>I moderately enjoy web-design; though not my first choice, I would be fine with working primarily in that field.
			</li>
			<li id="platform">
				<h4>Primary Computer-Platform:</h4> I am on a 6-year-old laptop running <q>Pop! OS</q>, a distribution of Linux based on Ubuntu 22.04. <br>I <i>have</i> an installation of Windows, but it takes so long to start up that I really can't use it regularly. (Not that I would, anyway; it's the least-efficient, least-secure major operating-system.)
			</li>
			<li id="courses">
				<h4>My 2024-Fall Courses:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li><h5>WEB115 &ndash; Web Markup and Scripting:</h5> This course. I'm taking it because learning to do web-dev is important to a programmer who doesn't know what field they'll end up working in. Also, it's in my major.</li>
					<li><h5>CTS130 &ndash; Spreadsheet:</h5> A course on how to properly use spreadsheet-applications like MS Excel. Software like that offers a faster and simpler (though far-less-upscaleable) version of what a database-centric application might, and is thus useful for working thru smaller problems based on datasets. That's probably why it's in my major.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li id="trivia">
				<h4>Fun Facts about my Font-Design Hobby:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I am almost entirely self-taught; I downloaded FontForge, poked around in it for three years, and now I'm an amateur font-designer.</li>
					<li>I have five fonts in active development. Only one of them is even close to being done.</li>
					<li>The font that's closest to being done currently supports five dead languages (Ogham, Scandinavian Runes, Lycian, Carian, and Old Italic), and one dead numeric-system (Mayan). (This number will likely increase.)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
