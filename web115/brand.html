		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<blockquote class="attributed">
			<p>Robots already have plenty of potential to be truly lovable &ndash; it's just that nobody else seems to have realized that.</p>
			<p>&mdash; Skog Irons, Founder of Lilith RoboticsCorp.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>Our mission at Lil'RoboCo (Lilith RoboticsCorp) is to create lovable, intelligent lifestyle-assistance robots, and make them available to fit into the lives of common consumers. Unlike the cleaning-bots of yester-generation, or the converations-AIs and <i><q>companionship</q></i>-droids of more recent times, what we seek to provide are robotic companions who offer support in both an emotional <i>and</i> functional sense.</p>
		<p>For example, take our first-ever product: The AmobeaPet (original name: <q>AmobeaDog/Cat/Hedgehog,Etc.</q>); it is a high-quality floor-crawling cleaner-robot, with functionality on-par with any of those you might find without an absurd price-tag attached to them. However, because it's made by us, it <i>also</i> greets you as you pass by, enjoys being pet, and will get lonely if haven't paid attention to it in a while. And these are not primative, poorly-implemented features; they are driven by sophisticated AI developed by our computer-scientists over in R&amp;D. And all of that, we offer to you at prices competitive with medium-high-end machines with the same cleaning-functionality.</p>
		<p><q>&#191;How is that a sustainable business-model, especially if you're doing a bunch of R&amp;D?</q>, you might ask. Well, we're counting on <i>you</i> to give us enough business to let us keep making our dream a reality. <q class="speech">&#191;And don't you wanna?; C'mon: <i>Robopets. Robofriends. <em>Robospouses</em>.</i> &#161;We can actually make those happen!</q></p>
		<p>(That last part curtesy of the founder, Skog Irons.)</p>

		<h1>About Our Branding</h1>
		<p>As with the default setting of the digital displays on our robot-models, the general idea for the aesthetic of our website is <q>futuristic sci-fi</q>; we want users to feel that they're reading a holographic-terminal-display from a sci-fi movie. (We experimented with actual holographic-display technology, but found it quite hard to actually read.)</p>
		<h2>Colors</h2>
		<p>For our text-colors, we go with a base of bright-green on midnight-blue, for that <i><q>digital</q></i> feel. For highlights, we use amber and white, for contrast.</p>
		<h2>Text</h2>
		<p>For our font, we use Fira Sans, for its modern, slightly-futuristic look.</p>
